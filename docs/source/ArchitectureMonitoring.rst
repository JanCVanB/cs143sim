Monitoring
==========

The outputs of the simulation are records of various simulation variables over time. These records are generated by monitoring simulation variables over the course of the simulation. Monitoring can be performed either by evenly-spaced Record events or by recording simulation variables at every simulation event.

Variables
---------

These are the variables to monitor:

- Link Rate for each Link
- Buffer Occupancy for each Link
- Packet Loss for each Link
- Flow Rate for each Flow
- Window Size for each Flow
- Packet Delay for each Flow

.. note:: Should we monitor any other simulation variables
