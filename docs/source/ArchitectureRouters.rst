Routers
=======

Routers mainly forwards data packages between computer networks. The router tables decide which paths to forward current packages. Typically routers do not involved in CCA.

Control
-------
 
How to manage router tables:

- Static and dynamic routes are stored in Routing Information Base
- Build a router table
- Update a router table
- Classical algorithms: Bellmen-ford, Dijkstra, etc

Forwarding
----------
- The router forwards data packets between incoming and outgoing interface connections by reading header in packets.
- How to deal with the situation when packets arrive at a rate higher than the router can process.
